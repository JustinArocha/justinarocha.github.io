        <p>
          My senior design project Petter where we designed an app in React Native
          that would help a new pet owner with all their pet needs in one consolidated
          area. This is a version that tracks the backend and allows for basic app use.

    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p style = "text-align: center">
      My name is Justin Arocha, and I am a web designer specializing in content creation and search engine optimization. <br>

      <br>While web design was not my original career path, I have always had a strong passion for creating and building things. 
      During my time in college, I was introduced to a wide range of disciplines, including web design, and quickly 
      discovered a genuine interest in the process. What drew me in was the combination of creativity and problem-solving, 
      as well as the satisfaction of seeing a project evolve from concept to finished product.<br>

      <br>I am particularly motivated by the sense of accomplishment that comes from completing meaningful work. One of the 
      most defining examples of this was a mobile application my team and I developed during our senior design course. 
      The project culminated in an open showcase, where we presented our work to faculty, peers, and industry visitors. 
      Being able to confidently demonstrate the app, discuss our design decisions, and receive positive feedback on such 
      a large-scale first project was an incredibly rewarding experience.<br>

      <br>That experience reinforced my desire to continue building thoughtful, user-focused digital products, and I carry 
      that same level of pride, attention to detail, and enthusiasm into every project I work on.
