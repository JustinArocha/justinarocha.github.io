        <h4>Petter</h4>

        <p>
          My senior design project Petter where we designed an app in React Native
          that would help a new pet owner with all their pet needs in one consolidated
          area. This is a version that tracks the backend and allows for basic app use.

    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p style = "text-align: center">
      My name is Justin Arocha, I am a web designer who specializes in content creation and search 
      engine optimization. <br>

      <br>Web design was not always my first choice but I had always had a desire and love of making things
      ever since I was little and coming to college allowed me to be exposed to different subjects
      including the process of web design which I absolutely loved. I think that after working hard on a big 
      project seeing the fruits of your labor in the final product is feeling that could not be replicated and 
      look for the feeling with every project I work on. The biggest example of that proud feeling was the 
      app we worked on during our senior design class that we were able to present in an open showcase for our 
      school and anyone else interested in taking a look at our projects. The ability to show off and talk 
      so passionately about the app we made is such a memorable experience and hearing the feedback and 
      praise for the work we were able to put together as a first time attempt at something so large is 
      something I look forward taking to wherever I may find myself next.
