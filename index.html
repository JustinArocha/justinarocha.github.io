    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p style = "text-align: center">
      I’m Justin Arocha, a web designer specializing in content creation and search engine optimization, with a strong 
      interest in building clean, user-focused digital experiences. <br>

      <br>Although web design wasn’t my original career path, I’ve always been driven by a passionfor building and 
      creating. During college, exposure to web design sparked a strong interest in the field, particularly the balance 
      of creativity and problem-solving, and the satisfaction of turning ideas into finished products.<br>

      <br>One of my most impactful experiences was developing a mobile application as part of my senior design project. 
      Presenting the app at an open showcase to faculty, peers, and industry visitors, and receiving positive feedback,
      confirmed my desire to pursue a career creating thoughtful, user-focused digital experiences.<br>

      <br>I bring that same pride, attention to detail, and enthusiasm to every project I work on.
